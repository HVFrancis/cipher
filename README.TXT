PROJECT TITLE: cipher
This project implements the encryption system from
Nova: Decoding Nazi Secrets, Clasroom Activity at
https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/teachers/activities/2615_decoding.html

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To demonstrate a simple substitution cipher and a more
complicated cipher involving shifting the cipher wheel.
I created this project to help encrypt and decrypt messages turned in by
my students as part of an assignment in my Introduction to Computer Science
class's unit on encyrption.
VERSION or DATE: 2018.12.06

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: This project (currently) required BlueJ to interact with

AUTHORS: Howard V Francis

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

For Part 1 of the activity, create a CodeWheel object using the default constructor.
When calling the use method, use a shift of 1; this will match the substitution cipher
of that part

For Part 2, create a MiniEnigma object. The values for startIndex and shift match those
discussed in the activity. An entire message can be encrypted or decrypted using the 
appropriate method
